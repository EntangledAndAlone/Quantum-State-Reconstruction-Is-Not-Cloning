Quantum State Reconstruction via Reversible Unitaries and Dual-Axis Projections

Abstract

This model introduces a method for reconstructing quantum states without full-system measurement. By using a known sequence of reversible unitary operations and minimal perturbations, the system enables efficient state regeneration from partial readout. 

Instead of treating the quantum state itself as primary, this approach treats the transformation history (unitary stack) as the data layer. Using dual-axis projection (e.g., X and Y), it reduces readout overhead and avoids state collapse.

Core Method

Let |ψ₀⟩ be the initial state.
Apply a known unitary transformation U:
 |ψ₁⟩ = U|ψ₀⟩

Apply a secondary unitary V to a selected qubit:
 |ψ₂⟩ = V|ψ₁⟩

You can reverse the entire process:
 |ψ₀⟩ = U⁻¹ V⁻¹ |ψ₂⟩

Measure only the perturbed qubit using dual-axis projection (e.g., X and Y axes). Using the projection vector and the inverse of the transformation chain, regenerate the original state.

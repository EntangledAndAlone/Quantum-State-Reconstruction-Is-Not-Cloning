Quantum State Regeneration – Dual-Axis Projection Encoding
A New Approach to Quantum State Recovery with No-Cloning Compliance

Overview
This repository introduces a transformation-based method for quantum state regeneration. By employing dual-axis projection encoding and reversible unitary operations, this model allows for lossless recovery of quantum states, preserving the integrity of entanglement and fidelity while respecting the no-cloning theorem.

The core concept of this method lies in linear state reconstruction using known transformation histories, and localized perturbations to guide the recovery of full quantum states without violating fundamental quantum principles.

Key Features:
No full-system measurement: Reduces destructive sampling costs.

Linear Reconstruction: Achieves state recovery with reduced overhead.

No state duplication: Fully compliant with the No-Cloning Theorem.

Dual-Axis Encoding: Allows for partial yet complete state inference.

Methodology
Initial State: A quantum system begins in a known basis state.

Transformation Stack (U): Apply a sequence of reversible unitary transformations.

Local Perturbation (V): A small, known transformation is applied to specific qubits.

Dual-Axis Projection: Measurement of qubits across two orthogonal axes (e.g., X and Y).

State Regeneration: Using inverse unitary operations (U⁻¹ and V⁻¹), the original state is reconstructed.

Why This Matters
Quantum systems, especially distributed ones, face enormous challenges due to the destructive nature of standard measurement protocols. By shifting the focus from the quantum state itself to the history of transformations, we provide a method that allows for reversible state reconstruction with far less computational overhead and loss of information.
